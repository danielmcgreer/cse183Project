This is the code repository for our CSE 183: Web Applications Final Project.
Here we have created a website where UCSC students can collaboratively rate courses
they have taken and give useful insight to students who may plan on taking the same courses.

The front page is a large search bar, and nothing else. We designed it like this to make 
it very clear to our users on how they will be navigating this website.
The search bar is dynamic. Once you start entering keys a drop down with possible search matches of courses appears.
By clicking one of the drop downs it takes you to a courses review page. If you hit enter it brings up a page
where you can scroll through possible course matches. Courses have averaged rating at the top and you can 
see the professor a student had, the review they left, the rating they gave, the username of the person who wrote it, 
and also when they wrote it.
You can dynamically edit your own reviews or delete them. In the upper right you can sign out or be taken to 
a page that has all of your reviews. There is numerous error checking like making sure a review is filled out for all fields,
a user is signed in to write a review, duplicate courses cannot be added, and more. 

Hope you enjoy!
